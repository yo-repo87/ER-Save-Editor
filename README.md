Tool for editing Elden Ring save files. Compatible with PC saves, raw Playstation saves, and Playstation Save Wizard exported saves.

**Use with caution:** This tool should be used responsibly. Always backup your save file before making any edits. This is a hobby project developed during spare time and is intended for easier character build making. I do not endorse or condone cheating online.

## Web version
Runs entirely in your browser via WebAssembly -- nothing is uploaded anywhere, your save file stays local.

## Bug fixes
- Fixed several crash/panic paths (out-of-bounds stat table lookups, unmapped weapon/gem IDs, malformed save-format parsing) that previously brought down the whole app on edge-case input
- Fixed raw PlayStation saves being rejected outright as "not a recognized Elden Ring save" -- the magic bytes were never checked for
- Removed an incorrect assumption that a certain save field's first byte was always `0`, which caused legitimate real-world saves to fail to load

## Permissions
Feel free to use this save editor for learning or development purposes. However, I do not authorize its use for creating tools or modifications that enable actions online outside the bounds of what the game allows.

## FAQ
Q: Will this ban me?<br/>
A: There's no guarantee that you won't be banned. None of these features have been tested online.

## Reporting Issues
If you encounter any bugs or issues while using the save editor, please report them. When reporting bugs, try to provide reproducible steps so I can debug effectively.
